#Assignment Operators
#Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
#Operator	Example  	Same As         Try it         Output       Description
#   =	    x = 5	    x = 5            x = 5         5        Assign the value 5 to variable x
#   +=	    x += 3  	x = x + 3        x += 3        8        Add 3 to x
#   -=	    x -= 3  	x = x - 3        x -= 3        5        Subtract 3 from x
#   *=	    x *= 3  	x = x * 3        x *= 3        15       Multiply x by 3
#   /=	    x /= 3  	x = x / 3        x /= 3        5.0      Divide x by 3
#   %=	    x %= 3  	x = x % 3        x %= 3        2        Get the remainder of x when divided by 3
#   //=	    x //= 3  	x = x // 3       x //= 3       1        Perform floor division on x by 3
#   **=	    x **= 3  	x = x ** 3       x **= 3       125      Perform exponential calculation on x by 3
